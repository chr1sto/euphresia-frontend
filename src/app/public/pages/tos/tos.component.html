    <div class="block">
        <p>(a) Waiver, Severability and Interpretation. The failure of Euphresia to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The term "including" means "including without limitation." Section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against Euphresia by virtue of having drafted them.</p>
        <p>(b) Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made hereunder to Euphresia are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Euphresia and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Euphresia shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.</p>
        <p>(c) Controlling Law and Jurisdiction. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with these Terms will be brought solely in Santa Clara County, California, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts.
